# si5351
## A Simple Arduino Nano based controller for the Si5351 chip

This sketch has been reduced to the bare minimum and uses Jason Milldrum's Si5351 library.
The three oiutput frequencies are set in lines 11 to 13 whilst the output levels and set in 16 to 18
In the test model, the three output levels were measured as: -0.7dBm, +5.3dBm and +11.1dBm all measurements were with the output terminated in a 50R load.
